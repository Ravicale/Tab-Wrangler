# Tab-Wrangler
Simple quality of life addon i've been making for Mozilla Firefox that makes tab management easier.

Current commands:
    Alt+M : Mute/Unmute all tabs in current window.
    Alt+Shift+M : Mute/Unmute all but active tab in current window.


Todo:
    Improve responsiveness of muting/unmuting. The current way the query request is handled simply feels terrible and unresponsive.
    Allow for shortcuts to be remappable in the addon options menu.
    Add shortcuts for pinning/unpinning tabs.
    Possibly look into shortcuts for moving tabs between windows.
